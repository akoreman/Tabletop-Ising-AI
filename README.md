# Tabletop Ising Model AI
Reinforcement learning agent trained to play my Ising model game (https://github.com/akoreman/Tabletop-Ising-Model-Game). Implemented using the Unity3D ML agents package.

### Currently Implemented:
* Set-up the game to be able to support agent interaction.
* Sends ball position, power-up positions and height of the moving platforms to the brain.
